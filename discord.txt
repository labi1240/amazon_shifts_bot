⏺ Great! No syntax errors. Now let me also test that the Discord webhook is working by creating a
  simple test:

⏺ Write(test_discord.py)
  ⎿  Wrote 54 lines to test_discord.py                    
     #!/usr/bin/env python3
     """
     Test Discord notification functionality
     """
     import logging
     from enhanced_notifier import EnhancedDiscordNotifier
     from page_objects.shift_booking import ShiftSlot
     # Set up logging
     logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
     … +44 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Bash(python test_discord.py)
  ⎿  🧪 Testing Discord notification system...

     🎉 Discord notification test successful!
     … +8 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! The Discord notification test was successful. Let me clean up the test file:

⏺ Bash(rm test_discord.py)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ 🎉 Discord Notifications Successfully Enabled!

  I've successfully set up Discord notifications for your Amazon Shift Bot. Here's what I implemented:

  ✅ Changes Made:

  1. Added Enhanced Discord Notifier Import:
    - Imported EnhancedDiscordNotifier from enhanced_notifier.py
  2. Initialized Notifier in Monitor:
    - Added notifier initialization in EnhancedIntegratedMonitor.__init__()
    - Includes proper error handling if initialization fails
  3. Fixed Notification Method:
    - Updated _send_booking_notification() to use notifier.notify_booking(slot)
    - The enhanced notifier provides rich Discord formatting automatically
  4. Tested Successfully:
    - Discord webhook is working correctly
    - Test notification was sent successfully

  📋 How It Works:

  When a shift is successfully booked, the bot will now:

  1. ✅ Detect successful booking (already working from your logs)
  2. ✅ Call notification method on line 845 of enhanced_integrated_monitor.py
  3. ✅ Send rich Discord message with all booking details
  4. ✅ Log success in the bot logs

  🔔 Discord Message Format:

  The notification will include:
  - 🎉 Celebration header
  - 📋 Job title and details
  - 📍 Location information
  - 🕐 Schedule/shift times
  - 💰 Pay rate
  - 🔗 Job ID and correlation ID
  - ✅ Success confirmation

  📁 Files Updated:

  - enhanced_integrated_monitor.py:13,33-37,875-876 - Added notifier import and initialization

  Your Discord webhook URL from the .env file is properly configured and the bot is ready to send
  notifications for future successful bookings! 🚀

  The next time the bot successfully books a shift, you'll get a beautiful Discord notification in
  your channel.
